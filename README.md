FINAL PROJECT
# About this project
This project is a part of a Front End Web Dev course at Ironhack.
It features a simple to-do app for task organization. In order to improve the presentation I have given it a name: ‘Origamee’ and developed a brand with its colors, logo and a slogan.


We were asked to employ four functions that are necessary to implement persistent storage applications: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). For this project, Supabase is used to guarantee smooth exchange of data.


#Technologies Used
   •   HTML5
   •   JavaScript
   •   Tailwind CSS
   •   Vue
   •   Supabase


#STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONALITY
The aim of this app is to help organize various tasks and divide them into groups. Not only does it allow to create a list of tasks, but it also adapts to a multidimensional lifestyle in which we have to keep track of different areas such as work, school, personal or professional projects etc.


   •   Log In / Register Page: the app detects if the user hasn’t been logged in then he’s automatically being redirected to this page
   •   Home: This page greets the user by name and welcomes him to add a new task with its category. When he created a task, the categories appear too
   •   Tasks: This page showcases a list of tasks that are included in a particular group and it allows editing and deleting tasks.
   •   User: shows relevant information about the user


We were also requested to ensure the design is responsive and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.


#How to Use
